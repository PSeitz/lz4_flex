//! LZ4 Block Format
//!
//! As defined in <https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md>
//!
//! Currently for no_std support only the block format is supported.
//!
//! # Example: block format roundtrip
//! ```
//! use lz4_flex::block::{compress_prepend_size, decompress_size_prepended};
//! let input: &[u8] = b"Hello people, what's up?";
//! let compressed = compress_prepend_size(input);
//! let uncompressed = decompress_size_prepended(&compressed).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(input, uncompressed);
//! ```
