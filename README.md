# lz4_flex

![lz4_flex_logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PSeitz/lz4_flex/master/logo.jpg)

Fastest LZ4 implementation in Rust. Originally based on [redox-os' lz4 compression](https://crates.io/crates/lz4-compress), but now a complete rewrite.
The results in the table are from a benchmark in this project (66Kb JSON, 10MB dickens) with the block format. 

AMD Ryzen 7 5900HX, rustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16), Manjaro, CPU Boost Disabled, CPU Governor: Performance

## Features
- Very good logo
- LZ4 Block format
- LZ4 Frame format (thanks @arthurprs)
- High performance
- 1,5s clean release build time
- Feature flags to configure safe/unsafe code usage
- no-std support with block format (thanks @coolreader18)
- 32-bit support

## Usage: 
Compression and decompression uses no usafe via the default feature flags "safe-encode" and "safe-decode". If you need more performance you can disable them (e.g. with no-default-features).

Safe:
```
lz4_flex = { version = "0.11" }
```

Performance:
```
lz4_flex = { version = "0.11", default-features = false }
```

If you know guaranteed your data is valid and not broken or corrupted, you can use `unchecked-decode` feature-flag to get a little bit more performance during decompression.
Ususally you don't want this, use case may be:
- Compression/Decompression happens in memory.
- The compression runs sandboxed so out of bounds reads/writes are not a problem.
- The data is checked against a checksum.
```
lz4_flex = { version = "0.11", default-features = false, features = ["unchecked-decode"] }
```

### Block Format
The block format is only valid for smaller data chunks as as block is de/compressed in memory.
For larger data use the frame format, which consists of multiple blocks.

```rust
use lz4_flex::block::{compress_prepend_size, decompress_size_prepended};

fn main(){
    let input: &[u8] = b"Hello people, what's up?";
    let compressed = compress_prepend_size(input);
    let uncompressed = decompress_size_prepended(&compressed).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(input, uncompressed);
}
```


## no_std support

no_std support is currently only for the block format, since the frame format uses `std::io::Write`, which is not available in core.

## Benchmarks
The benchmark is run with criterion, the test files are in the benches folder.

Currently 4 implementations are compared, this one, [lz-fear](https://github.com/main--/rust-lz-fear), the [c version via rust bindings](https://crates.io/crates/lzzzz) and [snappy](https://github.com/burntsushi/rust-snappy). 
The lz4-flex version is tested with the feature flags safe-decode and safe-encode switched on and off.

- snap: https://github.com/burntsushi/rust-snappy 

Tested on AMD Ryzen 7 5900HX, rustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16), Manjaro, CPU Boost Disabled, CPU 3GHZ

### Results v0.11.0 02-06-2023 (safe-decode and safe-encode off)

![Decompress](./decompress_bench.svg)

### Results v0.11.0 02-06-2023 (safe-decode and safe-encode on)
`cargo bench`

## Miri

[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) can be used to find issues related to incorrect unsafe usage:

`MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-disable-isolation -Zmiri-disable-stacked-borrows" cargo +nightly miri test --no-default-features --features frame`

## Fuzzer
This fuzz target generates corrupted data for the decompressor. 
`cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_decomp_corrupt_block` and `cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_decomp_corrupt_frame`

This fuzz target asserts that a compression and decompression rountrip returns the original input.
`cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_roundtrip` and `cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_roundtrip_frame`

This fuzz target asserts compression with cpp and decompression with lz4_flex returns the original input.
`cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_roundtrip_cpp_compress`

## Bindings in other languages
 - Node.js: [lz4-napi](https://github.com/antoniomuso/lz4-napi) 
 - Wasm: [lz4-wasm](https://github.com/PSeitz/lz4-wasm)

## TODO
- High compression

## Migrate from v0.10 to v0.11
0.11 inverts `checked-decode` feature flag to `unchecked-decode`.
Previously setting `default-features=false` removed the bounds checks from the
`checked-decode` feature flag. `unchecked-decode` inverts this, so it will needs to be
deliberately deactivated.

To migrate, just remove the `checked-decode` feature flag if you use it.
